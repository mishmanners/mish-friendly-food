description: 'Generate tests for the website to check functionality'
---

Always create tests for new code added to the website, but only for these functions:
- Translation
- Translation results
- Webpage loading
- New features as they are added

When writing tests, please follow these guideslines:

* Comment the code to show what the test does
* 2-3 of each type of test is fine
* Use Playwright for the testing framework
* Make sure tests are easy to read and understand

Use clear, simple language and avoid unnecessary jargon.
